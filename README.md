# a simiple auto grad engine for cpp


## usage
as it is, it is a simple auto grad engine for cpp currently only supports diff of scalar value ops but i will include the matmul and its diff.

since it built on top of xtensor cpp library it is horribly slow to use and i hope to write the matmul and its def functions soon to make it faster 

### TODO

- [ ] add matmul and its diff
- [ ] add structs for arrays instead of using xtensor
- [ ] add more basic nn functions
- [ ] add more optimizers
- [ ] add more activation functions
- [ ] add more loss functions
